I got help from w3schools site for these definitions. Good reading.

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
A function can return data as a result.

If

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

Elif
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

Else
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

While Loops
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

Lambda
A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
